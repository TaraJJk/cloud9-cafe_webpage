	<h1><u>Hot Americano</u></h1>
	<font size="4">
		<p>An Americano is a great choice for starting the morning without doing damage to your whole day's diet. Made with two shots of espresso and filled with hot water the rest of the way, this drink hardly makes a dent in your health routine. An Americano is an espresso drink made with hot water and espresso, also called a Caffe Americano. The drink can be made with either one or two shots of espresso, and varying ratios of water. Diluting the strong dark espresso roast brings the flavor closer to a drip coffee: which might be where the name originated!</p>
		<p>An Americano has approximately as much caffeine as drip coffee, although the specific amount of caffeine might vary slightly. According to the Mayo Clinic, an 8-ounce cup of coffee has between 95 and 200 milligrams of caffeine.</p>
