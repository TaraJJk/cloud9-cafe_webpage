		<p>Caffè macchiato, sometimes called espresso macchiato, is an espresso coffee drink with a small amount of milk, usually foamed. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" or "spotted" so the literal translation of caffè macchiato is "stained” or “marked coffee.”</p>
		<p>What is a macchiato coffee? In Italian, macchiato means “spotted.” This refers to the typical spot on the top of the drink, caused by a barista pouring espresso directly into a small amount of steamed milk, leaving a spot of espresso on top of the milk. This drink is traditionally served in a smaller espresso cup.</p>
