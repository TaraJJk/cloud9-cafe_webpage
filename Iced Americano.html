	<font size="4">
		<p>Iced Americano: Espresso + cold water + ice. That's literally it. Same exact coffee base (espresso, which means the same amount of caffeine), same exact temperature (chilled + ice), and a simple difference in the type of cold liquid used to fill each drink to the top (milk vs. water). This drink is 15 calories and has zero sugar. Espresso can be bitter, so this order is not for the faint of heart.</p>
		<p>Like so many foods and nutrients, too much coffee can cause problems, especially in the digestive tract. But studies have shown that drinking up to four 8-ounce cups of coffee per day is safe. Sticking to those boundaries shouldn't be hard for coffee drinkers in the U.S., since most drink just a cup of java per day.</p>
