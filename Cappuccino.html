    <h1>Cappuccino</h1>
    <p>
        Cappuccino is similar to a latte, but the difference lies in the amount of foam and the addition of a chocolate sprinkle on top. 
        Outside of Italy, cappuccino is typically composed of a single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. 
        The top third of the drink consists of milk foam, often decorated with artistic drawings made using the same milk, called latte art.
