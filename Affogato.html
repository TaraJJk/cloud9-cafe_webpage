    <h1>Affogato</h1>
    <p>
        More than just a coffee, an Affogato is a dessert made of a single or double shot of espresso served over a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 
        It is served in a tumbler glass. Why is it called affogato? Here's what you need to know in order to be an affogato aficionado: 
        Affogatos originated in Italy; indeed, the name "affogato" comes from the Italian word "affogare," or "to drown." 
        The name is apt: The dessert is made of gelato literally drowned in espresso.
    </p>

        The rewards are twofold: The coffee gives you energy, and the ice cream makes you happy. 
        But nothing beats a properly made affogato, which is to say some supercold gelato with a shot or two of hot espresso. 
        The magic of an affogato is that even a bad one can be very good, but a very good one can change your life.
