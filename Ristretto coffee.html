	<h1><u>Ristretto Coffee</u></h1>
	<font size="4">
		<p>Ristretto is a "short shot" of a more highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted with a finer grind using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a Ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot.</p>
		<p>Also enjoy the true essence of ristretto, you'll need to forget your frothy milk. That's because ristretto is conventionally consumed as a black shot. But, you can also use a double or single ristretto, according to your preferences.</p>
