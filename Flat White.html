		<p>The flat white coffee is an espresso-based coffee drink accompanied with steamed milk and microfoam. This microfoam is made up of steamed milk which is gently infused with air. ... Baristas also should add only a thin layer of foam onto a flat white to prevent any distraction due to different textures.</p>
		<p>Made by combining short shots of espresso with steamed whole milk, the flat white is a concentrated coffee drink that's low in sugar. Although a tall serving contains 13 grams of sugar from milk, it's free of added sugars, syrups, and sweeteners.</p>
