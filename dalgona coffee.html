    <h1>Dalgona Coffee</h1>
    <p>
        Dalgona coffee is a beverage made by whipping equal parts instant coffee powder, sugar, and hot water until it becomes creamy and then adding it to cold or hot milk. 
        Occasionally, it is topped with coffee powder, cocoa, crumbled biscuits, or honey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dalgona coffee is reportedly named after a similarly sugary and foamy South Korean candy. 
        While Iâ€™ve never tasted it, it's easy to see the visual appeal: the ingredients transform into a silky, pillowy foam, a process that has gained massive popularity on social media.
